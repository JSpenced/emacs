  "Delete the rest of the current line; if no nonblanks there, delete thru newline.
With prefix argument ARG, delete that many lines from point.
Negative arguments delete lines backward.
With zero argument, deletes the text before point on the current line.

When calling from a program, nil means \"no arg\",
a number counts as a prefix arg.

To delete a whole line, when point is not at the beginning, type \
\\[move-beginning-of-line] \\[delete-line] \\[delete-line].

If `show-trailing-whitespace' is non-nil, this command will just
delete the rest of the current line, even if there are no nonblanks
there.

If option `delete-whole-line' is non-nil, then this command deletes the whole line
including its terminating newline, when used at the beginning of a line
with no argument.  As a consequence, you can always delete a whole line
by typing \\[move-beginning-of-line] \\[delete-line].

If you want to append the deleteed line to the last deleteed text,
use \\[append-next-delete] before \\[delete-line].

If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the line, but put the line in the delete ring anyway.  This means that
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.
\(If the variable `delete-read-only-ok' is non-nil, then this won't
even beep.)"
